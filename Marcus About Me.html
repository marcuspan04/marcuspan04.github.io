            		<h1>About Me</h1>
            		<p>I’m a team-oriented Rotman Commerce student with experience supporting client work and coordinating operations, and I value clear communication, structure, and reliability in everything I do. I enjoy contributing to projects where I can learn quickly, take ownership, and deliver high-quality work. Outside of academics, I stay active through weight training, which helps me maintain discipline and focus, and I also have a strong appreciation for music. You can probably tell I enjoy designing as well, reflected in this website I have built.
